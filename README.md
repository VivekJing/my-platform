## Steedos DX

With Steedos DX, metadata can be imported into Steedos, modified in the product interface, and synchronize back to project source code. 

Steedos DX introduces a new way to organize your metadata and distribute your apps. You can benefit from modern collaboration technologies such as Git to version control everything across your team - your code, your org configuration, and your metadata.
